# Thriftology: Vintage Clothes Shopping Website

Thriftology is a prototype PHP-based web application created as a school project, showcasing a potential online marketplace for vintage clothing. Designed with a custom MVC architecture and using PDO for secure database operations, it simulates the experience of buying and selling vintage items. While it currently operates only as a display model without real transaction capabilities, Thriftology offers a glimpse into the functionalities and user experience of a community-driven vintage clothing platform.
